## RawInput2

An external software that ports [momentum mod's](https://momentum-mod.org/) ``m_rawinput 2`` behaviour. This option provides mouse interpolation which will ["line up with the tickrate properly without needing to have a specific framerate"](https://discord.com/channels/235111289435717633/356398721790902274/997026787995435088) (rio). The code for this isn't public and was reverse engineered from the game.

### Usage
* Launch the game in ``-insecure`` mode. (It wont work otherwise!)
* Run the application.
* Make sure to set ``m_rawinput 2`` in game for it to take effect.

### Building requirements
* [Microsoft Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours)


Summary: Why GModâ€™s Raw Input Handling is Broken and Why RawInput2.exe Canâ€™t Fix It
Garryâ€™s Mod (GMod) has fundamentally flawed raw input handling, which makes it impossible to properly port RawInput2.exe. Unlike Counter-Strike: Source (CS:S), which processes raw input in sync with the gameâ€™s tick rate, GMod's raw input logic is desynchronized, inconsistent, and laggy by default.

Key Issues with GModâ€™s Raw Input Handling
âœ” Raw input updates even when no movement is happening.
âœ” Polling is inconsistent and desynchronized from the gameâ€™s tick rate.
âœ” Movement input is applied at incorrect times, leading to stuttering and lag.
âœ” Even without external modifications, GModâ€™s input is inherently sluggish.
âœ” Input appears to be applied before physics updates, causing unnatural acceleration.

Why RawInput2.exe Canâ€™t Fix This
ðŸš« RawInput2.exe relies on the game already handling raw input correctly.
ðŸš« Since GModâ€™s raw input is flawed at the base level, smoothing it externally wonâ€™t fix the issue.
ðŸš« Even if movement is spread evenly (like in CS:S), GMod still applies it incorrectly.
ðŸš« The only real fix requires modifying GModâ€™s internal input processing.

Conclusion
The core issue lies in GModâ€™s raw input pipeline, not in how RawInput2.exe processes movement. Until Facepunch fixes this at the engine level, raw input in GMod will remain unreliable, making a proper RawInput2.exe port functionally impossible.
